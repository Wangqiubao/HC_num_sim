The stability of the system changes as the time delay rises, and the system has a periodic solution.

4.Figure5.m:
Effect of different time delays on periodic oscillation when k = 0.1. Set tau to 10,15,20, respectively.
The number of symptomatic infections increases as the reporting time delay grows.

5.Figure7.m:
Time series diagram of Q/N with different reported delays tau (a) k=0.001, (b)k=0.4.
(a)k=0.001, tau=1,8,17,26.
The increase of time delay makes the peak size almost unchanged, but delays the arrival time of the peak.
(b)k=0.4, tau=0.1,0.85.
The increase in reporting delay diminishes the peak and delays its arrival. 

6.Figure8.m:
Time series diagram for Q/N with tau=1 and different sensitivity coefficients k
tau=1, k=0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5
The arrival time of the peak value is delayed as the sensitivity coefficient k increases, and the peak value decreases obviously.

The stochastic P bifurcation is captured.

8.Figure10.m:

The stability of the system changes as the  noise intensity K rises.

9.Figure11.m:
Variance plot of Q for different noise intensities at tau = 10, epsilon =0.01
Set K to 1,10,15,20 respectively. The variance of the random process considerably rises as the noise level does

10.Figure12.m:
The probability density diagram of Q/N with tau = 10, epsilon = 0.01. 
Set K to 0.0001,20 respectively. The noise intensity increases and the system loses stability over a period ranging from 2000 to 5000. 

11.Figure13.m
Time series diagram of different publicity strategies.
(a)k=0.001,tau=27;
k=0.008,tau=7;
(b)k=0.02,tau=4;
k=0.003,tau=13;
(c)k=0.25,tau=1.09;
k=0.2,tau=0.99;
k=0.35,tau=0.92;
k=0.4,tau=0.85;
k=0.45,tau=0.8;
k=0.5,tau=0.75

In fig. 13(a), an increase in the value of k results in the peak arrival time being shifted forward by 20 days. Increasing threshold by re-
ducing the intensity of publicity,  the peak size may increase, as illustrated in fig. 13(b). In fig. 13(b), reducing the value of k leads to an increase in the
peak number of symptomatic infections by 600 individuals.
In fig. 13(c), the larger the publicity intensity, the smaller the peak, and the later the peak arrives
